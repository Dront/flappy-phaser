# Flappy phaser

Flappy bird game clone. Created to learn a bit of js and [phaser](https://phaser.io/) game engine.

### Useful commands
```bash
npm i  # setup
npm start  # localhost dev server
npm run start-global  # externally visible server
```

### TODO
- fix rendering in mobile landscape mode
- load custom font before game starts
- highlight score if this is a new highscore
- add animation to player
- add nicer path
- add background
